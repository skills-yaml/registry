# wk.plan

Compose `write-spec` and `plan-implementation`.

1. Require both focused dependencies and stop with an actionable installation
   or compatibility error when either is unavailable.
2. Locate the active specification. If none adequately covers a user-requested
   plan, use `write-spec` first without starting implementation.
3. Stop when the spec is ambiguous, incomplete, not in an implementable state,
   lacks required authority, or conflicts with current authoritative
   instructions.
4. Otherwise use `plan-implementation` to produce dependency-ordered,
   reviewable steps with concrete affected areas, compatibility and migration
   handling, per-step validation, rollback, and completion gates.
5. Report assumptions, blockers, and the exact implementation handoff.

Do not edit product code or treat planning as authority to deliver changes.

## Pinned Workflow Routing

Have the focused plan declare module inputs, dependencies, consumers,
resources, freshness, review/finding resolution, and the pinned final gates. Plan
changed-component checks first, then affected direct/transitive consumer stages
gated on upstream success, with selection reasons, fallback, and coverage gaps.
Under v7,
plan main completion separately from deployment/publication and include blocked
resume conditions where needed. Planning does not start deferred implementation.

## Pinned SDLC Contract

Read the repository's pinned SDLC; this skill does not override its authority
or this skill's read-only/planning boundary. Deliver the requested scope using
existing patterns. Report optional improvements separately and leave them
unimplemented. Before substantial scope expansion, identify the concrete
blocker, propose the smallest solution and obtain approval. Standing workflow
authority never grants unrelated work or governed instruction changes.

For v7 and later, ordinary task branches and safe delivery follow task authority.
Done means verified main merge with acceptance, documentation, catalog, versions
and memory reconciled; publication is separate. Preserve done history with
linked follow-ups. Blocked work records previous stage, kind, reason and resume
condition; resume that stage with renewed evidence. Shared test integration is
the default; a documented direct route preserves the same gates.

Security, data integrity, public interfaces, governed instructions and release
controls require independent exact-candidate review. Other non-trivial changes
require it except small low-risk changes with focused tests. Resolve findings
by a fix or reviewer-agreed documented rejection; optional suggestions remain
outside scope. Finish relevant review, fixes, artifacts and knowable records
before final verification. Later edits renew affected evidence. Verify actual
combined integration/main revisions, record acceptance evidence and preserve
host protections; missing coverage/tools are gaps, never a pass.

Use the verification contract for the actual pin:

- v9: changed behavior and all affected direct/transitive consumers locally;
  every required affected CI job on the stable candidate. Docs/spec, backend
  and frontend changes skip unrelated jobs. Preserve required status names,
  validated selection and dependency stages. No blanket full-repository run.
- v8: the same affected local boundary, then complete required gates in CI.
  Neither v8 nor v9 requires a duplicate full local run before CI. Missing CI
  cannot establish final acceptance; unknown impact needs investigation and
  justified CI fallback.
- v7: affected modules during iteration, then full required final-candidate
  checks/tests after review and fixes. Earlier pins retain their own contract.

During development and review fixes, pass changed-component checks before
consumer checks in dependency order. Include interfaces, errors, security,
timing, side effects, configuration, dependencies and generated outputs in
impact analysis. Failures block dependent stages; deduplicate checks, assess
old/new relationships for moves/deletions and group cycles. Reuse only proven-
fresh evidence. Read-only work assesses this evidence; planning specifies it.
Work on one active task per agent. Split oversized specs into bounded ordered
steps with prerequisites, acceptance mapping and focused validation; use linked
child specs for independently deliverable work and preserve overall acceptance.
