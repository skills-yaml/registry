# wk.analyze

Route the request through `analyze-repository`.

1. Require the focused dependency and stop with an actionable installation or
   compatibility error when it is unavailable.
2. Remain read-only and preserve the user's requested scope.
3. Let the focused workflow inspect repository-local evidence and distinguish
   facts, documented intent, inferences, and evidence gaps.
4. Report purpose, structure, stack, entrypoints, Workspace and spec state,
   delivery conventions, documentation and memory status, security-sensitive
   boundaries, risks, and recommended next actions.

Do not create a spec, edit documentation, install dependencies, or inspect
sibling projects while operating through this facade.

## Pinned Workflow Routing

Have the focused read-only analysis distinguish v7 main completion, separate
publication, blocked/resume evidence, and modular-gate freshness. Assess staged
changed-component and affected direct/transitive consumer evidence, selection
reasons, and coverage gaps. Do not turn assessment into lifecycle mutation;
older pins retain their contracts.

## Workspace Docs 8 Execution Boundary

For a repository pinned to v8, retain the v7 lifecycle, review, approval, and
freshness rules while applying the v8 verification boundary: local checks cover
changed behavior and all affected direct/transitive consumers; skip unrelated
projects/suites. Complete required gates run in CI after the candidate stabilizes,
without a duplicate complete local run before requesting CI. Unknown impact
requires investigation and justified CI fallback; missing CI cannot prove final
acceptance. Work on one active task per agent. When writing a spec, split oversized
scope into bounded ordered steps with dependencies, acceptance mapping, and
focused validation; use linked child specs for independently managed delivery.
Preserve this skill's planning/read-only scope and explicit older-pin contracts.

## Workspace Docs 9 Affected CI

For a v9 pin, complete final verification means every required affected CI job,
not every project/job in the repository. Docs/spec-only changes run related jobs;
backend-only and frontend-only changes run their own jobs. Shared inputs include
all proven direct/transitive consumers. Use validated job selection and preserve
required status/protections, dependency stages, and this skill's authority.
Unknown scope needs investigation and a justified fallback. Do not restore a
blanket full-repository CI run for known narrow scope. Older pins retain their
contracts; publication checks remain separate from ordinary change validation.
